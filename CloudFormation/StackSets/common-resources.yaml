Description: |
  This template has resources that will be installed into all managed accounts
  in the OU. For the purposes of the sample it's not important what exactly we
  are creating here. To demonstrate the consolidated logging, errors can be
  introduced into this template, such as choosing a bucket name that already
  exists. This template uses a Rain module, which can be packaged with `rain
  pkg -x common-resources.yaml`.
